				<p class="greetings">Greetings, I'm Steven Thiriot, a 15-year-old navigating the academic landscape as a sophomore at
					Bountiful High School. Amidst the rigors of homework, my downtime transforms into a haven for
					diverse hobbies, a space where my ever-evolving skills take center stage. My journey into the realm
					of programming commenced in third grade, igniting a passion that persists today. The thrill of
					crafting intricate code and witnessing digital landscapes come to life is a perennial source of
					fascination.<br><br>

					Since 2020, my ventures have expanded into the captivating domains of 3D printing and modeling. The
					hum of the 3D printer and the meticulous process of bringing digital designs into the tangible world
					have become integral facets of my creative repertoire. Beyond academia, I've embarked on a
					professional trajectory, currently serving as a server at Barton Creek Senior Living. This role not
					only contributes to my personal growth but also sharpens my focus on shaping a promising future.<br><br>

					In my quest for knowledge, I've delved into the intriguing fields of PCB design and electronics,
					opening up avenues for exploration and discovery. As I straddle the responsibilities of school,
					work, and personal interests, I am driven by a resolute commitment to continuous learning and the
					unwavering pursuit of a future defined by innovation and personal fulfillment.

						Over the years, my skill set has undergone significant growth. My journey started in third grade
						when I delved into the world of programming, with Python as my initial canvas. Back then, my
						creations were simple programs crafting intricate shapes and patterns. Fast forward to today,
						Python has evolved into the programming language I am most adept at. I've progressed beyond
						drawing shapes to crafting advanced programs; one notable project involves web scraping weather
						data and presenting it in an ordered list, ready for versatile applications.<br><br>

						Several years ago, I acquired an affordable 3D printer, sparking my fascination with
						customization. I've invested time and effort in modifying and maintaining it to a point where I
						can trust it to reliably bring my designs to life. The 3D printing journey prompted me to
						explore the world of 3D modeling, leading to a two-year deep dive into the intricacies of Fusion
						360. I've dedicated countless hours honing my skills, modeling anything from functional
						replacements—like a part for a broken music stand—to more intricate designs that cater to
						various needs. This evolution showcases not only my technical proficiency but also my commitment
						to expanding my capabilities in the ever-evolving landscape of technology and creativity.
